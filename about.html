                        <p>This is a movement and sound performance that explores the distortions of a moment, a
                        moving paralysis, through the concept of Habitus. The stretch, contraction and
                        fragmentation of a moment’s borders, the expression of bliss through chaos. The
                        presentation of a moment on infinite stasis.</p>

                        <p>An end, as opposite to doom, is the only certainty we carry through life. An end is a fast
                        cut, a brief exhalation of conclusion. Doom is the everlasting moment that precedes the
                        end. Doom’s perception of a lost present is inscribed in and reproduced in our everyday
                        experiential spaces, as ideas of what is yet to happen, but never comes, as a form of
                        paralysis. A distorted moment which’s borders are so blurred, that it passes and constantly
                        renews itself without notice. Something that stretches itself until it becomes something
                        else.</p>

                        <p>Doom is a state of Entropy.</p>

                        <p>This work was developed having in mind the pace in which we live constantly in, reflecting
                        the experience of an eternal end through chaos.</p>

                        <p>This work is created as something that repeats itself and through repetition becomes
                        something new. You can access it any time, and as you refresh the page, you will get an
                        entirely different order of videos and sound, which is randomly combined by an algorithm.</p>
